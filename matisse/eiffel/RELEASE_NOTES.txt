		Matisse Eiffel Binding 9.1.x Release Notes
		+----------------------------------------+



1 - Test Suite Compilation
+------------------------+

Problem:
--------

The test suite compilation fails with the following error:
Error code: VTCT

Error: type is based on unknown class.
What to do: use an identifier that is the name of a class in the universe.

Class: TS_SUMMARY
Unknown class name: RX_REGULAR_EXPRESSION in gobo_test			


Solution:
---------

Edit $ISE_LIBRARY/library/gobo/gobo_test.ecf
Add line:
<library name="gobo_regexp" location="$ISE_LIBRARY\library\gobo\gobo_regexp.ecf"/>



2 - Missing Features
+------------------+

- Features in MTINDEX do not work with all the datatypes only STRING and 
  INTEGERs are supported. The way to extend it is describe in the feature's 
  code. For all the missing types use a SQL select statement

- MT_PREPARED_STATEMENT does not work with all the datatypes. Conversion 
  of some value list types still need to be implemented

- MT_OBJECT_ITERATOR does not implement all the features that developers are 
  used to such as 'do_all', etc.


3 - STORABLE binding
+------------------+

The MT_STORABLE-based version of the Matisse-Eiffel binding is now deprecated.
Existing applications based upon the STORABLE binding need to include 
both the 'matisse' and 'matisse_storable' clusters and use the new 
MT_STORABLE_DATABASE class to connect to a Matisse database.

To re-generate, the MT_STORABLE-based class, use the --storable option as 
follows:
mt_sdl stubgen --lang eiffel --storable -f <ODL file>
