This example demonstrates how to use the generated opengl wrappers.
It creates two glut windows. If the user closes any one of them
the application will quit.

In the library directory of the opengl example directory, you
will find a very tiny and incomplete eiffel library. This demonstrates
how an intermediate library, between the generated wrappers and the
application programmer could look like.
