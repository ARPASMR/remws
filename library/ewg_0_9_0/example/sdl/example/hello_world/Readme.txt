This example demonstrates how to use the generated SDL wrapper.
It creates a SDL window displays a image in it, waits a bit
and quits.

Please not that this example demonstrates the usage of the wrapper
in its most direct way. In real life, if you want to create a
user friendly SDL wrapper you provide your own abstraction between
the generated wrapper and the application programmer.
