This example demonstrates how to wrap and use gtk2.
Please note that not only must gtk2 runtime be installed, 
but also the gtk2 development files must be present.


Download and install the devlopment kit and the runtime kit from:
http://www.dropline.net/gtk/index.php . 

Set the environment variable %GTK2% to the directory where you installed the development package to.
Now, add %GTK%\bin and %GTK%\lib to %PATH%. Set %GTK_RUNTIME% to the path where you installed the runtime package to.
Add %GTK_RUNTIME%\lib to %PATH%. Done
