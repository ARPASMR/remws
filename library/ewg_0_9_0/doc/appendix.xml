    <title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>
    <section id="faq_001">
      <title>Why is the Windows distribution of EWG so much bigger?</title>
      <para>
	 Because the Windows headers are so much bigger.
	 The platform specific distributions already contain the generated
	 wrapper code. The bigger the header, the bigger the resulting wrapper code.
      </para>
    </section>
    
    <section id="faq_002">
      <title>Does EWG support C++ as well?</title>
      <para>
	 No, EWG does not support C++. It only supports C.  C and C++
	 are two distinct languages and C++ is far more complex.
	 <ulink
	     url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ceug/">WrapIt</ulink>
	 is a tool that tries to wrap both C and C++
	 libraries. WrapIt is not a fully automated wrapper generator
	 as EWG is. It is my understanding that WrapIt does not parse
	 the C/C++ header directly but instead reads an interface
	 file, that the user needs to provide.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="faq_003">
      <title>Why does the generated C glue code produce C-compiler warnings?</title>
      <para>
	 There are a couple of areas where EWG doesn't have all
	 information it would need to properly satisfy all C
	 compilers. This is being worked on and the warnings will
	 eventually disappear.
      </para>
