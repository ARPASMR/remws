NAME
----
remwsgwyd - remws web service network gateway


SYNOPSIS
--------
*remwsgwyd* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The remwsgwyd service acts as a network gateway between REMWS web service
and clients.


OPTIONS
-------
*-p 'port'::
    Is the network port on which remwsgwyd will accept connections, default value: 9090.

*-l 'log-level'::
    Is the logging level that will be used, default value: debug-level (7).
    The available logging levels range from 0 to 7 with the following meaning:
        - 7    debug level
        - 6    informational level
        - 5    normal but significant conditions
        - 4    'warning' conditions
        - 3    'error' conditions
        - 2    'critical' conditions
        - 1    'alert', action must be taken immediatly
        - 0    system is unusable

*-gcm 'message-number'::
    Activates GC monitoring and checks GC parameters every 'message-number' messages, default value: 10.000.

*-gcoap 'coalesce-period'::
    Sets GC coalesce period, default value: 2.

*-gcolp 'collection-period'::
    Sets GC collection period, default value: 2.

*-mt 'threshold'::
    Sets GC memory threshold, default value: 40.000.000 bytes.

*-mm 'memory'::
    Sets the maximum memory amount the eiffel runtime can allocate, default value: 160.000.000 bytes.

*-gct 'gc-behaviour'::
    GC behaviour setup. Three values available:
        - t: (tiny)    optimize memory allocation for size
        - c: (compact) balance memory optimization between speed and size, shrinking allocated memory.
        - s: (speed)   optimize memory for speed
    default value: t (tiny).

*-fst ::
    Forces Nino sinle threaded, default value: Nino multi-threaded.

*-t ::
    Uses the testing web service instead of the production one, default value: production server.

*-u ::
    The box runnin 'remwsgwyd' is set in UTC, default value: local time.

*-v ::
    Nino set to verbose mode, default value: non verbose.

*-syslog ::
    Uses syslog utilities, default value: do not use.

*-h ::
    Prints a little help on usage.

*-license ::
    Prints the GPLv2 license on screen.


REMARKS
-------
Garbage collection is on by default so it has to be setup to suite your needs.
If -h or -license options are used or no parameters are provided remwsgwyd terminates itself.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
There are some environment variables that can/must be defined in order to
setup Garbage Collection:

    * 'EIF_FULL_COALESCE_PERIOD':
        Period of full coalesce (in number of collections). If the environment variable EIF_FULL_COALESCE_PERIOD
        is defined, it is set to the closest reasonable value from it.
        If null, no full coalescing is launched.

    * 'EIF_FULL_COLLECTION_PERIOD':
        Period of full collection. If the environment variable EIF_FULL_COLLECTION_PERIOD
        is defined, it is set to the closest reasonable value from it.
        If null, no full collection is launched.

    * 'EIF_MEMORY_CHUNK':
        Minimal size of a memory chunk. The eiffel run-time always allocates a multiple of this size.
        If the environment variable EIF_MEMORY_CHUNK is defined, it is set to the closest reasonable
        value from it.

    * 'EIF_MEMORY_SCAVENGE':
        Size of generational scavenge zone. If the environment variable EIF_MEMORY_SCAVENGE is defined,
        it is set to the closest reasonable value from it.

    * 'EIF_TENURE_MAX':
        Maximum age of object before being considered as old (old objects are not scanned during
        partial collection). If the environment variable EIF_TENURE_MAX is defined, it is set to 
        the closest reasonable value from it.


EXAMPLE
-------
`remwsgwyd -l 1 -gcm 2000 -u -syslog`::
  Run the network gateway with log level set to alert, use syslog utilities, monitor gc every 2000 messages, the box running
  remwsgwyd is setup in UTC.
